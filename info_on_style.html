'#' in css is used to assign a class to a control having the same id as class name.
<p>
'.' is used for assign class to the control with class attribute.
<p>For e.g
<p>
&ltstyle type='text/css' &gt
<p>
#test { color:green;}
<p>
.test1 {color:red;}
<p>
&lt/style&gt
<p>
&ltdiv id="test"&gt This will have its css properties derieved from #test&lt/div&gt
<p>
&ltdiv class="test1"&gt This will have its css properties derieved from .test1&lt/div&gt

&ltcode&gt isn't supposed to stop HTML being rendered.
<p>It means "Present this in a way that indicates it is code" not "Don't treat this HTML as HTML".
<p>Use character references for characters with special meaning in HTML if you want them to be displayed (&amp;, &lt;, etc).

The Markdown documentation says:

Within a code block, ampersands (&) and angle brackets (< and >) are automatically converted into HTML entities.
… but code block means "When the markdown source is indented by 4 characters" not "When wrapped in pre/code".
