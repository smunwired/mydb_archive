<h1>Let's try again</h1>
<h2>22-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Birthday, bleugh!<br/>Anna came round with a cake and a pressie, the boys bought me a record I'd not heard of which is groovy and I waiting in dutifully for Gabriel's notebook. I'm not sure about doing this on a computer. I think I'd rather be writing. Tomorrow is monster shopping day, can't wait.
<h2>23-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Visited shops in London, failed to buy speakers, managed cds, vinyl, dvds and books. Always seems a bit lame, but I'd like them. Had a "dickfest"* at the new Foyles in Charing Cross Road.

<h2>24-Dec-2015</h2>
	<p>Supposed to be working, made a trip to the dump where it was surprisingly busy. Discovered there is a tweekie shop nearby but it was closed (that might have saved me a packet). Actually did some work, my only MySQL replicated daatbase has been broken for a month and no one but me knows. Anna came over, everything else stops! Boys at their mums', I watched The Queen and wrapped presents.
<h2>25-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Happy Christmas Everyone!
<p>I now know that Christmas Woman's Hours is especially to be avoided and restored my good cheer with "Two Sevens Clash", having started the day with Led Zep I & III whlist knocking up Cliveden Loaf and French Onion Soup. I need to do a ratatouille and rescue the cheesecake. Actually went for a run round the common before dinner, seemed quite surreal. Dinner all went civilised and edible, played several silly games after dinned, boys came back to my place after and I retired with the most splitting headache I have had in years, I'll swear I can still feel it now.
<h2>26-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Did nothing, nada, absolutely ziltch, what a waste of a day.
<h2>27-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Did not realise how crap I was feeling on Boxing Day until I woke up this morning. Tidied up a bit, cooked a decent dinner, Anna came round, then I took the boys off to London City Airport. Flybe is still my favourite way to get to Belfast.
<h2>28-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Driving lesson from my dad, I am now refamiliar with automatics, took mum to Tesco, cooked lunch, took G & I for a run while Jacob failed to visit Queen's library, his distractions to Botanical Gardens and Ulster Museum were more successful.
<h2>29-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>iPad ! The horror, the horror
<p>Dad set about fixing the broken suitcase handle.
<h2>30-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Nonchalantly packing bags for the early morning start was suddenly awoken by the absence of my and Isacc's passports. The weird replay thing that you can do in your head slowly got me to leaving them in the seat pocket on the flight over, luckily I have a driving licence and Isaac is under 16.
<h2>31-Dec-2015</h2>
<p>Flybe groundstaff, wow!
<h2>3-Jan-2016</h2>
<p>Did Cambridge Winter Open yesterday in the almost oppulent University Sports Centre. Instead of losing in the last 16 to the very fast Swede, I lost in the last 32 to a clubmate wh created the  difference by ducking as I overstepped, cleverer than me that's for sure.
Gabriel cooked Japanese style noodle soup which was very good. I rewatched Sherlock, understanding why I fell asleep first time.
<h2>4-Jan-2016</h2>
<p>Rose late, pottered, rewired a foil, finally built that amplifier kit, it was quite a bit easier than hoped for, seems to work quite well though. Anna came round, that went well.
<h2>5-Jan-2016</h2>
<p>Back to work! The bike ride was ok, I am witholding judgement on everything else.
